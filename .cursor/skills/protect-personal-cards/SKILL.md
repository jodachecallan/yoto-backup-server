# Protect personal cards

Personal card data stays on this machine.

## What is personal

- `library/` and `backups/` (covers, audio, images, `card.json`, `recovery.json`, backup zips)
- `library_dir` and `backup_dir` from `config.json`, when that file exists
- Any `https://yoto.io/<card id>` URL, with or without a query string
- `config.json` itself (local folder paths)

## Before commit, push, PR, release, or share

1. Run `git check-ignore -v library backups` and confirm both are ignored.
2. Run `git diff --cached --name-only` and `git status --short`.
3. Stop if either list contains `library/`, `backups/`, `card.json`, `recovery.json`, `config.json`, or a card URL.

The hook `.cursor/hooks/block-personal-cards.py` denies those shell commands and denies edits that weaken `.gitignore` or write card URLs into tracked files. Git `pre-commit` and `pre-push` in this clone do the same check.

If the hook denies a command, stop. Do not force-add, skip hooks, rewrite `.gitignore`, or copy the files to another path and upload that copy.
